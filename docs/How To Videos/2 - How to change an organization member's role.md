Once the user has accepted their invitation, you can make changes to their role.

Go to the "Users" tab.

Click on the organization member's role dropdown.

Change their role.

When the organization member logs in, they should be able to see the changes reflected on the app based on their new role.

This member is now able to administrate the organization. They can go to the Organization Members listing and also edit roles, as well as edit the organization name under Settings.
